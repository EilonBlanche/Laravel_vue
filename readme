My UI and UX implementation is the best because it is easy to use, user-friendly and lastly, cause it uses vue js, a popular javascript framework with big community that 
has lots of resources in the web for references.  It also uses concepts of OOP in both frontend (VUE) and backend (Laravel), MVC framework.
